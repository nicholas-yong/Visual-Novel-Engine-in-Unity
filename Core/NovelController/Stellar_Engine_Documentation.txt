--Dialog--
To create dialog for a character, follow this format:
            
CharacterName "Dialog"

You can only have one Character to speak on each line, and going to a new line finishes the Character's dialog. There are also quite a few modifiers you can add to Dialog:

Text Modifiers:
    - {c} Clears the previous dialog
    - {a} Appends the dialog after the {a} tag to the previous line of dialog
    - {w time} Clears the previous dialog, shows the dialog after time seconds.
    - {wa time} Appends the dialog to the previous dialog after time seconds.
Action Modifiers:
    - <txtSpd speed> Changes the text speed to whatever is indicated inside the speed variable.
Function Calls:
    - To perform Function Calls inside the Dialog, follow this format: [functionName(parameters)]

--Making Choices--
To introduce a Choice Section inside the dialog, follow the format below: ( make sure theres an empty line between the last line of Dialog and the line starting with choice ) as seen below, as well as an empty line afterwards. The Tab Formatting MUST also be followed.

    choice "What do you do?"
{
    "Run for your life"
    [
        narrator "I attempt to make a run for it.[playSound(Bush_Walking,0.2,1.0)] But she's too fast, far too fast for my feeble legs"
        Yong Yong "<i>Poke</i>. Ha, that's what you get for making the birds fly away."
    ]
    "Attempt a Hug"
    [
        narrator "I try and go in for a hug. It never works, but hugging Yong Yong is one of my irresitable pleasures.[changeExpression(Nick,Eager)][moveCharacter(Nick,1.0,0,0.8)]"
    ]
    "Call for Help"
    [
        narrator "I look wildly at the people around us. Oh no...., there's no one here. I'm doomed.[playSound(giant_walking,0.2,1.0)]"
        Yong Yong "<b>POKE</b> Hah, your belly is so round.
        Nick "Ouch! Hurt you know..."
    ]
}

--Characters--
Note: Character Sprites are assumed to be stored inside the following directory, Assets/Resources/Images/Characters/SpriteName.

    -Functions-
    Name: moveCharacter( string characterName, float xPosition, float yPosition, float speed opt )
    Description: Moves the Sprite of the specified Character to a new Position (xPosition, yPosition) inside the Game Window at the specified speed.
                 Note that the Anchor of all Sprites is considered to be the Anchor at the bottom left.
    Example: moveCharacter( Yong_Yong, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 )

    Name: setPosition( string characterName, float positionX, float positionY )
    Description: Moves the Specified Character instantly to a Location
    Example: setPosition( Yong_Yong, 1, 1 )

    Name: changeExpression( string characterName, string expressionName, float speed(optional) )
    Description: Changes the Currently Active Texture for a Selected Character
    Example: changeExpression( Yong_Yong, disgust )
    Notes: changeExpression creates the Character specified in characterName if they are not already created and sets them
           as active. Furthermore, the character's name is appended to expressionName for ease of searching.
           (E.G: disgust and Yong_Yong for characterName would be Yong_Yong_Disgust )

    Name: faceDirection( string characterName, const string direction )
    Description: Modifies the currently Active Sprite belonging to CharacterName in const direction. There are three different constants:
        - flip: Flips the Character's Sprite
        - left: Rotates the Sprite so that it's facing left
        - right: Rotates the Sprite so that it's facing right.
    Example: faceDirection( Yong_Yong, left )

--- Backgrounds ---
Note: The Relevant Background Textures are found inside the Following Path "Images/UI/Backdrops/Still/"
Note: Currently Animated Backgrounds are not supported. But that will be implemented in the future. Probably.
Note: The Relevant Transition Effects are found inside the Following Path "Images/TransitionEffects/"

    Name: setBackground( string texname, float spd(optional), bool smooth(optional), string transEffect(optional) )
    Description: Sets a specified picture for the Background Layer, transEffect can be passed as an optional transition effect
    Example: setBackground( forest, 1, true, fade )

    Name: setForeground( string texname, float spd(optional), bool smooth(optional), string transEffect(optional) )
    Description: Sets a specified picture for the Foreground Layer, transEffect can be passed as an optional transition effect
    Example: setForeground( forest, 1, true, fade )

    Name: setCinematic string texname, float spd(optional), bool smooth(optional), string transEffect(optional) )
    Description: Sets a specified picture for the Cinematic Layer, transEffect can be passed as an optional transition effect
    Example: setCinematic( forest, 1, true, fade )

--Audio--
Note: The Relevant Musics are found inside the Following Path: Audio/Music/
Note: The Relevant Sound Effects are found inside the Following Path: Audio/SFX

    Description: Plays a specified sound effect( according to the clipName ) at a specific volume and at a specific pitch.
    Example: playSound( thunder, 1, 1)

    Name: stopSound( string clipName, float destroyTime)
    Description: Destroys the specific sound effect specified by clipName after destroyTime seconds
    Example: stopSound( thunder, 1 )

    Name: playMusic( string clipName, float maxVolume, float pitch, float startingVolume, bool playOnStart, bool loop )
    Description: Plays the music specified by the clipName. The other parameters are fairly self explanatory I believe.
    Example: playMusic( party_music, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1)
